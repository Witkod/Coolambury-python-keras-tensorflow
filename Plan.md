# The Plan

## User Stories

1. User can input their nickname, and create a game room to play.
2. Users can select a predefined family of words for the game to draw from.
3. User can choose a game room, so that they can play with select other players.
4. Users can play a simple multiplayer game: charades. One user is selected to draw something based on a random keyword generated by the game. The other users are to guess the keyword based on the drawing. Score is awarded to the artist and others based on how fast players guess the correct word. After some time or after all users guessed correctly, the role of the artist is passed on to another user. After everyone has been able to draw a few times, the user with the most score is declared the victor and the game resets. 
5. Users can talk to each other through an in-game chat room, which also serves as a means to guess the word being drawn.
6. When drawing, users can change their pen's colour, size, clear the canvas, or erase parts of it.
